After having lots of fun with the breadboard version of my <a href="http://openaudio.blogspot.com/2016/11/a-teensy-hearing-aid.html">Teensy Hearing Aid</a>, I decided that it was much too bulky and fragile to be of much use. &nbsp;So, with some help, we designed and built or own custom audio interface for the Teensy 3.6. &nbsp;This new audio interface would take all of the elements of my breadboard system and bring them together into one unified board. &nbsp;Stick a Teensy 3.6 on top and it's good to go!<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-PN72owVXiYA/WLl5tFs3S7I/AAAAAAAAEK8/6NzBzPg_S2YNVVWshx8JeEWmusyX9mMdwCK4B/s1600/Parts%2Bof%2BTympan.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="361" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-PN72owVXiYA/WLl5tFs3S7I/AAAAAAAAEK8/6NzBzPg_S2YNVVWshx8JeEWmusyX9mMdwCK4B/s640/Parts%2Bof%2BTympan.png" width="480" /></a></div>As you can see, it's a lot smaller than my breadboard system. &nbsp;Most importantly, there are no loose wires flying around to get caught on things or to pick up noise. &nbsp;It's much more robust, thereby enabling you to be mobile. &nbsp;And being mobile is the best way to trying out your new audio processing algorithms. &nbsp; Being mobile is where things get fun.<br /><br />On of my favorite features is that the board has two tiny little microphones built into the board itself. &nbsp;So, for quick trials, all you need to do is plug in some headphones and you're ready-to-go. &nbsp;I even put a hole in the PCB so that you can clip in a lanyard thing and wear it around the neck. &nbsp;Sure, it's pretty nerdy to have raw, unenclosed electronics dangling around one's neck but, hey, I'm not afraid to show my geek pride.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-3HLCJ6jn8ig/WLl6KNLCNiI/AAAAAAAAELE/mYaC3WNs0GgPOEup6vKk959ixabIKw8kgCK4B/s1600/Wearing%2BIt.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="306" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-3HLCJ6jn8ig/WLl6KNLCNiI/AAAAAAAAELE/mYaC3WNs0GgPOEup6vKk959ixabIKw8kgCK4B/s640/Wearing%2BIt.png" width="480" /></a></div>When our new board is combined with the built-in capabilities of the Teensy, you've got a nice and compact little system for developing new audio processing algorithms. &nbsp;It's got a lot of really useful features!<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-xnHouiSKD0Q/WLl9cP6x75I/AAAAAAAAELg/uonizr4XG7cLfiZkw0LhxKYtQ-hgA49mACK4B/s1600/System%2BFeatures.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="432" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-xnHouiSKD0Q/WLl9cP6x75I/AAAAAAAAELg/uonizr4XG7cLfiZkw0LhxKYtQ-hgA49mACK4B/s640/System%2BFeatures.png" width="540" /></a></div>Now that I've got this cool little piece of hardware, I've got some colleagues who are going to start working with it, too. &nbsp;As more folks work with it, we figured that it needed a name. &nbsp;After trying out a bunch of names on friends, colleagues, and in the open-source community (and seeing what was available for handles at sites like GitHub), we chose the name <a href="http://www.tympan.org/">Tympan</a>. &nbsp;As an open-source hearing aid device, that name seems pretty decent to me!<br /><br /><u>Follow-Up</u>: If you're interested in the schematic and BOM, they're on the Tympan GitHub <a href="https://github.com/Tympan/Tympan_Library/tree/master/hardware/">here</a>.<br /><br /><u>Follow-Up:</u>&nbsp; I measured the self-noise and dynamic range of the Tympan board. &nbsp;It's pretty good! &nbsp;You can check it out <a href="http://openaudio.blogspot.com/2017/03/tympan-self-noise.html">here</a>.
