**Daniel Rasetshwane** directs the [Auditory Signal Processing Laboratory](https://www.boystownhospital.org/research/HearingResearch/Pages/Auditory-Signal-Processing-Laboratory.aspx) at
Boys Town National Research Hospital. His research interests include design and
evaluation of audio signal processing algorithms for hearing aids, use of
loudness as a suprathreshold measure of cochlear function, understating
suprathreshold heading deficits and hidden hearing loss, acoustic reflectance,
otoacoustic emissions, and cochlear mechanics. For Tympan, Daniel develops and
implements innovative hearing aid algorithms.
