title: About Tympan.org
---

Tympan is the first Open Source Hearing Aid development platform. We are
committed to open source design principles, and we firmly believe that in doing
so we can accelerate research studies and facilitate translation of novel
algorithms into widespread use.

Our ideal is to lower barriers for hardware and software refinement, and
facilitate translation of these advances into use in hearing aids, cochlear
implants, and consumer electronics devices. Tympan invites professional
engineers, academics, students, makers and hobbyists to participate by sharing
and engaging with our community forum and software/hardware repositories. Letâ€™s
make hearing assistive technology better, together!

Our [initial team](/who) is comprised of folks from the engineering firm
Creare, and the Auditory Signal Processing Laboratory at Boystown National
Research Hospital.   We are interested in partnering with more research groups
in industry and academia.  The Tympan project is funded by a grant from the
National Institute of Health in partnership with the National Institute on
Deafness and other Communication Disorders. 

<!-- TODO: If you or your group would like to be a part of the next
generation of hearing aids, reach out to us via contact@tympan.org. -->
